# Features Left to impliment 

<ul>

<li>the only feature left to impliment was the sign up button as it took much time to get it to validate , also it felt very counter productive due to the navigation being so easy to use </li>

<h2><img src="Assets/images/feature.png"></h2>

and also the hover in the main navigaiton hovers onto grey which wasnt intended but i wanted to show the user more liveliness when using the site, it would of taken more time to get it to look good with the current colours and styles this website uses 



# whats different from the normal submission 

## about us page 

<h2><img src="Assets/images/replacement.png"></h2>

# additional info 

## commits on github

on my old project there were inconsistant commits and on this version that issue should be resolved BUT there is one commit that is kind of big which is my 2/2 nav css commit which added not only styles but querys to the css style file

## the querys 

the querys should be better and more adjusted than before but on very few devices it looks somehwat not right due to it having akward widths and heights.

# thats it!

thank you for taking the time to read through all of this and i hope you enjoy the project!
